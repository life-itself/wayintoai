# Way Into AI - Logging Skill

This skill documents how to create log entries for the Way Into AI repository.

**Quick start**: Read the sections below when adding entries. For workspace instructions, see `AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Structure

```
wayintoai/
├── logs/           # Daily logs with wiki links
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
├── ref/            # Detailed reference entries
│   └── topic-name.md
├── links/          # Quick link collections
├── backlog/        # Items to process
└── SKILL.md        # This file
```

## Log Entry Process

### 1. Determine Entry Type

**Full reference entry:**
- Use when topic warrants detailed documentation
- Include frontmatter, links, screenshots, full context
- File location: `ref/topic-name.md`

**Simple log entry:**
- Use for quick notes, links without deep dive
- Just bullet point in daily log
- No separate ref file

### 2. Creating Reference Entries

**Default: Keep it concise**
- Brief description + screenshot is often enough
- Add detail only when specifically requested or clearly warranted
- Avoid massive essays unless the topic demands it

**File naming:**
- Use descriptive, URL-friendly names
- Examples: `msgvault.md`, `inference-sh.md`, `pi.dev.md`
- Hyphens for multi-word names

**Frontmatter (required):**
```yaml
---
created: YYYY-MM-DD  # Date the entry was added to the repo (required)
author: Author Name (if applicable)
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

**Important**: The `created` field should always be set to the date the entry was added to the repository in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, not the original publication date of the content.

**Minimal content structure** (default):
1. **Title (H1)** - Project/tool name
2. **Tagline/Description** - One-sentence summary
3. **Screenshot** (if web-based) - Using `screenshotit.app/URL` — **place immediately after the tagline, before Links**
4. **Links section** - Website, GitHub, docs, announcement
5. **Overview** - Brief what/why (2-3 paragraphs)
6. **Key Features** (optional) - If notable
7. **Use Cases** (optional) - If helpful

**Comprehensive structure** (when requested or clearly warranted):
- Add: Why It Exists / Why Interesting
- Add: Technical Details (stack, architecture, specs)
- Add: Detailed sections on features, philosophy, comparisons
- Add: Related topics, commentary, significance

**YouTube videos:** put the bare YouTube URL on its own line; Flowershow renders it as an embed. No iframe or screenshot needed.

**Screenshots (REQUIRED for web content):**
- **ALWAYS include for web-based tools, articles, or any public URL — except tweets**
- **Skip tweets (x.com / twitter.com):** X blocks screenshotit.app, which returns an "Access to x.com was denied" 403 image. Quote the tweet text instead.
- Use screenshotit.app: `https://screenshotit.app/{url}`
- Format: `![Description](https://screenshotit.app/https://example.com/)`
- **Place immediately after title/tagline, BEFORE the Links section**
- Service auto-caches, provides stable URLs
- Advanced options: `@full`, `@mobile`, `@refresh`
- Examples:
  - Website: `![Tool](https://screenshotit.app/https://dmux.ai/)`
  - Article: `![Article](https://screenshotit.app/https://anthropic.com/news/article)`

### 3. Updating Existing Entries

**When to add updates:**
- User provides feedback after trying a tool/product
- New significant features or developments
- Changed assessment or experience report
- Corrections or clarifications

**Format for user feedback/experience:**
```markdown
> **User Experience Note (YYYY-MM-DD):**  
> [User's feedback or experience report] — [Name]
```

**Placement:**
- Add near the top, after "What Is It?" or similar intro section
- Before detailed features/documentation
- Use blockquote format with bold heading for visibility

**Example:**
```markdown
> **User Experience Note (2026-02-26):**  
> After playing with this for a few weeks, haven't found it so satisfying yet. Maybe haven't got the knack. — Rufus Pollock
```

**Git workflow for updates:**
```bash
cd ~/src/datopian/wayintoai
git add ref/updated-file.md
git commit -m "Update: [item name] - add user experience note"
git push
```

**When NOT to update:**
- Minor typos or formatting fixes (batch these)
- Speculative changes without verification
- Opinions that contradict documented facts (add as separate note instead)

### 4. Daily Log Entries

**File location:** `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Format:**
```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## [[ref-file-name]] - Short Title

Brief description with key details. Maximum 1-2 sentences.
```

**Wiki links:**
- Use Obsidian-style: `[[filename]]` (without `.md`)
- Links resolve to ref/ entries
- **Keep description to 1-2 sentences maximum** — concise but captures the essence

### Featuring and newsletter selection

Record editorial selection on the canonical post or reference entry:

```yaml
featured: true
newsletter: standalone
```

- `featured: true` means selected for homepage coverage. The homepage is manually curated: also add its link to the existing post list in `index.md`. Metadata alone does not change the site.
- `newsletter: weekly` means a candidate for the weekly roundup.
- `newsletter: standalone` means strong enough to consider for a dedicated email; it can still be included in the weekly roundup if no dedicated email is sent.
- Omit `newsletter` when there is no selection. These values record editorial intent, not approval to send or evidence of delivery.

Keep the selection on one canonical item to avoid counting both a reference entry and its write-up. In a daily log, point to the selected item using repository-relative paths:

```yaml
newsletter_candidates:
  - posts/2026-09-18-typesafe-jev-system-one.md
```

For a log-only item, add a small reference entry when selecting it for newsletter coverage, put the selection metadata there, and link it from the log. This keeps selection at item level when a day contains several entries. Log prose remains limited to 1–2 sentences per entry.

During newsletter preparation, find candidates with `rg -n '^newsletter: (weekly|standalone)$' posts ref`, then read each item. After an item is actually emailed, add `newsletter_sent: YYYY-MM-DD` and, when available, `newsletter_url` to the canonical item; skip sent items by default in subsequent reviews. Selection and delivery are manual; no email automation is implied. The infrastructure changelog's `promote` flag remains a separate convention.

### 5. Git Workflow

**Add files:**
```bash
cd ~/src/datopian/wayintoai
git add logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md ref/new-entry.md
```

**Commit message format:**
```
Add [topic] reference and YYYY-MM-DD log

- Created ref/topic.md: detailed reference for [description]
- Added logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md: daily log with [[topic]] wiki link
- [Key details about the entry]
- [Any notable features/context]
```

**Beads sync:** `git push` also pushes the Beads Dolt data (`refs/dolt/data`) via `.beads/hooks/pre-push`. If the hook reports a failure, run `bd dolt push` by hand.

**Push — auto-push on commit (no wait):**
```bash
cd ~/src/datopian/wayintoai
git push
```
- GitHub PAT configured in remote URL
- **Push immediately on commit** — repo auto-pushes in the same step, no waiting for user.
```bash
cd ~/src/datopian/wayintoai
git push
```
- GitHub PAT configured in remote URL
- **Wait for user to request push** - don't push automatically after commit

## Examples

### Full Reference Entry (msgvault)

**Created files:**
- `ref/msgvault.md` - Full reference
- Updated `logs/2026-02-04.md` - Added wiki link

**Features:**
- Frontmatter with created date, author, tags
- Links to GitHub, announcement tweet
- Overview, key features, why interesting
- Technical details, context

**Log entry:**
```markdown
## [[msgvault]] - Local-first Email Archive

Wes McKinney (pandas/Arrow creator) built msgvault: local-first email archive 
powered by DuckDB with MCP server for AI agent integration. Handles 20 years 
of Gmail (2M emails, 150K attachments) in a single Go binary.
```

### Full Reference with Screenshot (inference.sh)

**Created files:**
- `ref/inference-sh.md`
- Updated `logs/2026-02-04.md`

**Special:**
- Included screenshot via `screenshotit.app`
- Hyphenated filename for domain name

**Screenshot:**
```markdown
![inference.sh homepage](https://screenshotit.app/https://inference.sh/)
```

### Domain/URL in Filename (pi.dev)

**Filename:** `pi.dev.md`
- Preserves dot for domain names
- User explicitly requested this format

## Guidelines

**Conciseness:**
- Log entries: 1-2 sentences capturing essence
- Reference entries: comprehensive but organized
- Use headers to break up long content

**Links:**
- Always include primary website
- GitHub if open source
- Announcement tweet/blog post if relevant
- Related documentation

**Tags:**
- Be specific and useful for search
- Include: technology stack, category, key features
- Examples: `[ai-agents, platform, durable-execution]`

**Screenshots:**
- Only for web-based tools/platforms
- Use screenshotit.app for automatic caching
- **Place at the TOP** of the ref file — after title/tagline, before Links and all other sections

## Tools

**screenshotit.app:**
- URL-based screenshot service
- Format: `screenshotit.app/https://example.com/`
- Modifiers: `@full`, `@mobile`, `@refresh`
- See: https://github.com/flowershow/screenshotit

**Obsidian wiki links:**
- `[[filename]]` - links to ref/filename.md
- No need for path or extension
- Works in Obsidian and compatible Markdown renderers

## Workflow Checklist

- [ ] Decide: full reference or simple log entry?
- [ ] If reference: create `ref/topic-name.md` with frontmatter
- [ ] If reference: include links, overview, features
- [ ] If web tool: add screenshot via screenshotit.app
- [ ] Update `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with wiki link entry
- [ ] Git add both files
- [ ] Git commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Wait for user to request push (don't auto-push)

## Notes

- Filename format can vary (hyphens, dots) based on topic
- User may specify preferred filename format
- Always use Obsidian wiki link syntax in logs
- Screenshots are optional but recommended for web tools
- Maintain consistent frontmatter format
